** About
After finding out about Iosevka circa 2017, it quickly became my favorite font.

# has been my favorite font that I started using circa 2017.

Out of all fonts I've used over the years — and I've used many of them — Iosevka
is the one that had the most sane defaults out of them all. That statement is
purely on subjective basis, but the fact is: Iosevka is also the the most
customizable font out of them all. You can try it out in the [[https://typeof.net/Iosevka/customizer][Customizer]].


Since defaults already look amazing to me, my variant doesn't change a whole
lot. I will probably tweak build plans as the time goes on and new versions of
Iosevka are released, but the main goal of this project was to have GitHub
Actions build the font.
